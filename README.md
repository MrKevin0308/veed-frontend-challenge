## Veed.io's Frontend Coding Challenge
The idea of this project is to implement a small client application for discovering trending repositories on GitHub.
- A list of the repositories created in the last 7 days with the most number of stars in github should be displayed and the user should be able to favourite them
- The favourited repositories should be visible either through a filter or in a different tab. Some basic info about the repo should be displayed, such as: repo name, link to GitHub, description and number of stars.
- To keep things simple, the favourites won’t be sent back to GitHub’s servers but just stored locally (e.g localstorage, cookies etc...).


## Tech stack used
- React.js + TypeScript
